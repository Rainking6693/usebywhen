```html
<!-- Before -->
<script async src="https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js?client=ca-pub-8455742387516671"
     crossorigin="anonymous"></script>

```

### Placement Consistency:
- All AdSense codes remain in the `<head>` section
- Placement after meta tags and before schema markup maintained
- Original formatting and indentation preserved
- `crossorigin="anonymous"` attribute maintained

## Quality Assurance

### Verification Steps Completed:

3. ✅ Verified old client ID completely removed
4. ✅ Confirmed new client ID present in all expected files
5. ✅ Maintained consistent code formatting
6. ✅ Preserved existing HTML structure

### Files Not Requiring Updates:
The following HTML files were checked but did not contain AdSense code:
- `contact.html` (Note: This was not in the search results, may not have AdSense)
- `privacy.html` (Note: This was not in the search results, may not have AdSense)
- `terms.html` (Note: This was not in the search results, may not have AdSense)
