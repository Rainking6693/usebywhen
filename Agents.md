Repository Guidelines for usebywhen.om
Agentic Coding Workflow

0\. Tasks

. Operating on a task basis. Store all intermediate context in markdown files in tasks// folders.

· Use semantic task id slugs

1\. Research

. Find existing patterns in this codebase

. Search internet if relevant

. Start by asking follow up questions to set the direction of research

. Report findings in research.md file

2\. Planning

. Read the research.md in tasks for .

. Based on the research come up with a plan for implementing the user request. We should reuse existing patterns, components and code where possible.

. If needed, ask clarifying questions to user to understand the scope of the task

. Write the comprehensive plan to plan.md. The plan should include all context required for an engineer to implement the feature.

3\. Implementation

. Read. plan.md and create a todo-list with all items, then execute on the plan.

&nbsp;. Go for as long as possible. If ambiguous, leave all questions to the end and group them.

4\. Verification

. Once implementation is complete, you must verify that the implementation meets the requirements and is free of bugs.

. Do this by running tests, making tool calls and checking the output.

. If there are any issues, go back to the implementation step and make the necessary changes.

· Once verified, update the task status to "verified".
